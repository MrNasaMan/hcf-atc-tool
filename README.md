# Honolulu Control Facility ATC Tool

An ATC tool developed for the Honolulu Control Facility using electron.js. 
Currently uses vatsim metar api, data stream, and aviation api to get charts. 

Using electron on first release, currently in proccess of updating procedures. 
Package and package-lock not included, Developers will need to download all packages themselves and set up electron in the package.json. Documentation for electron can be found here: www.electronjs.org

Chart API does not have serve side CORS headers thus, a proxy is used as a bandaid patch. A better solution is currently being worked on
